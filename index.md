## Welcome to Daniel Rubens' GitHub Project Page

I am a fiercely entrepreneurial businessperson with many years of product, customer, marketing, and business development experience running a renowned architectural lighting studio in Manhattan, NY. I have an advanced degree in business and analytics and am a Python programmer with machine learning and big data training. I'm also fanatical about virtual and augmented reality and after many years in Manhattan have found myself living in Bellevue, WA.

I'm using this page to host projects I've worked on in analytics, big data, and machine learning. New projects will be posted regularly.

#### Thank you so much for visiting my page!
